#Prop It Up
A practice assignment for the CodingDojo MERN Stack React Functional Components section

Create a component called PersonCard that accepts the following props: 

    firstName
    lastName
    age
    hairColor

Then, display four PersonCard components that show four different people, using props.

** This will not require a form for data input.  Use static information passed through component attributes (props).
